# URL forwarding to Google Drive Link using Cloudflare

Make sure you have access to the DNS settings of your domain to be able to set this up in Cloudflare using page rules[^1]. You need to the following things in order to setup domain forwarding to a google drive link. 

eg: I'm forwarding `resume.kunalkeshan.dev` 👉 `https://drive.google.com/file/link-to-my-resume`

## Add Google's DNS to your Subdomain

| Type | Name | Content | Proxied |
| --- | --- | --- | :---: |
| A | resume | 8.8.8.8 | ✔️ |
| A | resume | 8.8.4.4 | ✔️ |

After pointing the subdomain to Google's DNS[^2], make sure proxied is enabled, without this Cloudflare cannot forward the configured URL to the google drive link.

## Setup Page Rule to Redirect to the Google Drive

Head over to `Manage Domain` > `Rules` > `Page Rules`, and create a new page rule with the following details. 

- URL as `resume.kunalkeshan.dev/`
- Page Setting to be `Forwarding URL`
- Status Code as `301`
- Finally destination URL as `https://drive.google.com/file/link-to-my-resume`

Give it a minute or 2 before testing it out and it should redirect to your assigned google drive link.

Test mine out 👉 [resume.kunalkeshan.dev](https://resume.kunalkeshan.dev).
