# Setting Up Automation in Kit (formerly ConvertKit)

This happened a couple of weeks ago, working with [Diveakssh](https://diveaksshschae.com/) on setting up automation in Kit. We were working on [Jungli The Nomad Newsletter](https://newsletter.junglithenomad.com/profile) where we needed to automate the process of sending emails to users based on certain triggers.

On the Free plan, Kit allows you to send emails to your subscribers based on triggers like when they join a form, or when they make a purchase. However, the automation feature is only available on the paid plan.

We required the automation feature to send welcome emails to users based on their first signup to a form source or a newsletter page source. This could've been achieved with the help of incentive emails, but we wanted to make the process more seamless and automated.

Editing incentive emails for each form source or newsletter page source would've been a manual process and would've required us to keep track of the emails sent to users. This is where the automation feature came in handy.

The image below shows how we went from a manual process (right) to using automation (left) to send emails to users based on triggers (form submissions create a new subscriber in Kit, which in turn triggers the welcome to jungli sequence).

Also made a video on how to set up automation in Kit, which you can watch [here](https://youtu.be/Hnbw6f4EfX4).
