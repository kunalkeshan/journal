# Update Docker Compose Image Version with Bash Script on Google Cloud Compute Instance

## Introduction

Managing Docker Compose services on a Google Cloud Compute Engine instance can be tedious when you need to frequently update image versions. Every time I needed to update a version, I had to manually `cd` into the directory and run the `docker compose up` command. To streamline this process, I created a Bash script that automates these tasks.

## The Solution: Automated Update Script

Here's a Bash script that accepts the service name and version as arguments, updates the Docker Compose file, and then brings up the containers:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# update-service.sh
#
# This script updates a specified service in the docker-compose file to a new image version,
# verifies that the new image exists (by attempting a docker pull), and then brings up the containers in detached mode.
# Detailed error output is provided if any step fails.
#
# Usage: ./update-service.sh <service_name> <new_version>
# Example:
#   ./update-service.sh myapp v1.23

# Define colors and emojis for output
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
RED='\033[0;31m'
YELLOW='\033[0;33m'
NC='\033[0m'        # No Color
TICK="✔"
CROSS="✖"

# Check if two arguments are provided
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
  echo -e "${RED}${CROSS} Usage: $0 <service_name> <new_version>${NC}"
  exit 1
fi

SERVICE_NAME="$1"
NEW_VERSION="$2"
COMPOSE_FILE="docker-compose.yml"

# Check if the docker-compose file exists in the current directory
if [ ! -f "$COMPOSE_FILE" ]; then
  echo -e "${RED}${CROSS} Error: $COMPOSE_FILE not found in the current directory.${NC}"
  exit 1
fi

# Verify that the specified service exists in the docker-compose file
if ! grep -E "^[[:space:]]*${SERVICE_NAME}:" "$COMPOSE_FILE" > /dev/null; then
  echo -e "${RED}${CROSS} Error: Service '$SERVICE_NAME' not found in $COMPOSE_FILE.${NC}"
  exit 1
fi

# Extract the block corresponding to the specified service and then grab the first image line
SERVICE_BLOCK=$(sed -n "/^[[:space:]]*${SERVICE_NAME}:/,/^[[:space:]]*[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+:/p" "$COMPOSE_FILE")
IMAGE_LINE=$(echo "$SERVICE_BLOCK" | grep -m 1 -E "image:")

if [ -z "$IMAGE_LINE" ]; then
  echo -e "${RED}${CROSS} Error: Image line for service '$SERVICE_NAME' not found in $COMPOSE_FILE.${NC}"
  exit 1
fi

# Extract the current full image string (e.g., asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/myapp/myapp-web:v1.24.1-rc)
CURRENT_IMAGE=$(echo "$IMAGE_LINE" | sed -E 's/.*image:[[:space:]]*//')

# Derive the image base (everything before the colon) so that we update only the tag
IMAGE_BASE=$(echo "$CURRENT_IMAGE" | sed -E 's/(.*):.*/\1/')

# Construct the new image name
NEW_IMAGE="${IMAGE_BASE}:${NEW_VERSION}"

echo -e "${YELLOW}Checking if image ${NEW_IMAGE} exists by attempting to pull it...${NC}"
# Capture the output of docker pull so that errors can be displayed
PULL_OUTPUT=$(docker pull "$NEW_IMAGE" 2>&1)
PULL_RESULT=$?

if [ $PULL_RESULT -eq 0 ]; then
  echo -e "${GREEN}${TICK} Image ${NEW_IMAGE} exists and was successfully pulled (or is already available).${NC}"
else
  echo -e "${RED}${CROSS} Error: Failed to pull image ${NEW_IMAGE}. Details:${NC}"
  echo -e "${RED}$PULL_OUTPUT${NC}"
  exit 1
fi

# Update the image tag in the docker-compose file using sed (scoping the change to the service block)
sed -i -E "/^[[:space:]]*${SERVICE_NAME}:/,/^[[:space:]]*[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+:/ {
  s|(image:[[:space:]]*${IMAGE_BASE}:)(v[0-9a-zA-Z\.\-]+)|\1${NEW_VERSION}|
}" "$COMPOSE_FILE"

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo -e "${GREEN}${TICK} Updated $COMPOSE_FILE: Service '$SERVICE_NAME' now uses version ${NEW_VERSION}.${NC}"
else
  echo -e "${RED}${CROSS} Error: Failed to update $COMPOSE_FILE.${NC}"
  exit 1
fi

# Bring up the updated containers
echo -e "${YELLOW}Starting Docker containers...${NC}"
DOCKER_UP_OUTPUT=$(docker compose up -d 2>&1)
DOCKER_UP_RESULT=$?

if [ $DOCKER_UP_RESULT -eq 0 ]; then
  echo -e "${GREEN}${TICK} Docker containers started successfully.${NC}"
else
  echo -e "${RED}${CROSS} Error: docker compose up failed. Details:${NC}"
  echo -e "${RED}$DOCKER_UP_OUTPUT${NC}"
  exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

## Making the Script Executable

Before you can run the script, you need to make it executable. This is a crucial step in Unix-like systems (including Linux) because:

1. By default, new files are created without execute permissions
2. The system requires explicit permission to execute files as a security measure
3. Without execute permissions, you'll get a "Permission denied" error when trying to run the script

To make the script executable, run:

```bash
chmod +x update-service.sh
```

This command:
- `chmod`: Changes the mode/permissions of a file
- `+x`: Adds execute permission
- `update-service.sh`: The target file

After making the script executable, you can run it using:
```bash
./update-service.sh myapp v1.23
```

## Issues Encountered and Solutions

When I first tried to use this script, I encountered several issues that needed to be addressed. Here are the main challenges and their solutions:

### 1. Authentication Issues with Google Artifact Registry

When executing the script:

```bash
sudo ./update-service.sh myapp v1.23
```

I received this error:

```
Checking if image asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/myapp/myapp-web:v1.23 exists by attempting to pull it...
✖ Error: Failed to pull image asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/myapp/myapp-web:v1.23. Details:
Error response from daemon: Head "https://asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/v2/my-project/myapp/myapp-web/manifests/v1.23": denied: Unauthenticated request. Unauthenticated requests do not have permission "artifactregistry.repositories.downloadArtifacts" on resource "projects/my-project/locations/asia-south1/repositories/myapp" (or it may not exist)
```

#### Solution: Configure Google Cloud Authentication

To fix this, you need to ensure proper authentication with Google Artifact Registry:

1. **Log in to Google Cloud:**
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   ```

2. **Configure Docker for the registry:**
   ```bash
   gcloud auth configure-docker asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev
   ```

### 2. Permission Issues with Sudo

Running the script with `sudo` can cause authentication problems because the root user doesn't inherit your Docker credentials.

#### Solution A: Run Without Sudo
1. Add your user to the Docker group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
2. Log out and log back in
3. Run the script without sudo:
   ```bash
   ./update-service.sh myapp v1.23
   ```

#### Solution B: Preserve Environment with Sudo
Run the script while preserving environment variables:
```bash
sudo -E ./update-service.sh myapp v1.23
```
Or configure Docker for the root user:
```bash
sudo gcloud auth configure-docker asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev
```

### 3. Verifying Image Availability

Before running the script, it's good practice to verify that the image exists and is accessible:

```bash
docker pull asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/myapp/myapp-web:v1.23
```

If this command succeeds, you have proper access and the script should work correctly.

## Conclusion

This automated solution significantly streamlines the process of updating Docker Compose services. While I haven't set up a full CI/CD pipeline yet, this approach provides a practical interim solution that reduces manual intervention and potential errors. The script includes error handling and clear feedback, making it easier to identify and resolve issues when they occur.
