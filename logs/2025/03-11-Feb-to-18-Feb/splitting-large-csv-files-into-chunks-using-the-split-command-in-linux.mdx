# Splitting Large CSV Files into Chunks Using the `split` Command in Linux [^1]

When working with large CSV files, such as during data migrations to a PostgreSQL database, processing the entire file at once can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Splitting the file into smaller chunks allows for parallel processing and easier management of the data.

## Using the `split` Command

The `split` command is a powerful tool for dividing large files into smaller, more manageable pieces.

### Example Command

```bash
split -l 5000 "sheet.csv" split --additional-suffix=.csv
```

This command splits the `sheet.csv` file into multiple smaller files, each containing 5,000 lines. The output files are named sequentially as `splitaa.csv`, `splitab.csv`, `splitac.csv`, and so on.

### Explanation of Options:

- `split`: The command used to split files.
- `-l 5000`: Splits the file into chunks of 5,000 lines each (`-l` stands for lines).
- `"sheet.csv"`: The input file to be split.
- `split`: The prefix for output files.
- `--additional-suffix=.csv`: Appends the `.csv` extension to each output file.

### Output Example:

```
splitaa.csv
splitab.csv
splitac.csv
...
```

## Why Use `split` for Large Files?

- **Efficient Processing:** Work on smaller chunks individually or in parallel.
- **Faster Database Imports:** Load smaller pieces into PostgreSQL with transactions.
- **Easy File Management:** Manage and track parts of large datasets conveniently.

## Practical Use Case

While migrating a large dataset from a CSV file to a PostgreSQL database, I encountered performance issues due to the file's size. By using `split`, I divided the data into smaller parts and imported them one by one, significantly reducing processing time.
