# Using Docker with Node.js During Development

Guide from official docker[^1] docs was sufficient to get this going.

## Prerequisites

1. Have Node.js Installed. [^2]
2. Have Docker Installed [^3]

## Create a Docker Image

```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile.dev
FROM node:20-alpine

RUN npm install -g pnpm

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package.json
# Was using pnpm workspaces, you can copy the lock file w.r.t your package manager
COPY package-lock.json package-lock.json

RUN pnpm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["pnpm", "run", "dev"]
```

## Run a container from the image

```yml
# docker-compose.dev.yml
services:
  users:
    container_name: users
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
    env_file:
      - .env
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    networks:
      users:
        ipv4_address: 172.18.0.3

  db:
    container_name: db
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    user: postgres
    environment:
      - PGUSER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_DB=app_name
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD", "pg_isready" ]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
    networks:
      users:
        ipv4_address: 172.18.0.2

volumes:
  db-data:

networks:
  users:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.18.0.0/16
          gateway: 172.18.0.1
```

Running the container

```bash
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

## Notes

Since I used for development purpose, I addded `.dev` extension to each for clear separation of what it's being used for. 

For production docker images I prefer to directly use `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` instead.
