# Picking up Sequelize (again)

Been a while since I worked with a SQL Database (Postgres). Using Firebase and MongoDB for quick development and side projects.

For work purposes using an ORM called Sequelize[^1], used it before, but been a while, so picking it up once again.

Current objective is to build a backend api in combination with Postgres. And trying to upgrade development at the same time, so paired up [docker configuration](./using-docker-with-nodejs-during-dev.md) to spin up a postgres server and have that connect to the node.js api.
