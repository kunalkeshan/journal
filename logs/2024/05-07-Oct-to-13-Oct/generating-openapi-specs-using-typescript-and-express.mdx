# Generating OpenAPI Specs using Typescript and Express

Working on a backend app right now, and needed to document the endpoints, and also didn't want to spend the time writing it from scratch. 

Used [tspec](https://github.com/ts-spec/tspec) to integrate with the code, picked up the types from the controller and just had to define the resposnes and the types along with it. 

## Steps to use tspec[^1]

1. Instal tspec

```bash
$ pnpm i tspec
```

2. Define a Spec

```typescript
import { Tspec } from "tspec";

/** Schema description defined by JSDoc */
interface User {
  /** Field description defined by JSDoc */
  id: number;
  fullName: string;
  username: string;
}

export type UserApiSpec = Tspec.DefineApiSpec<{
  paths: {
    '/users/{id}': {
      get: {
        summary: 'Get user by id',
        path: { id: number },
        responses: { 200: User },
      },
    },
  }
}>;
```

3. Generate the OpenAPI Specs

```bash
$ npx tspec generate --outputPath openapi.json
```
