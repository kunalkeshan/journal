# Uploading PDF Files to S3 via Signed URL in Next.js

## Overview

This document outlines the steps to upload PDF files from a Next.js application to an S3 bucket using a signed URL [^1]. It includes prerequisites, detailed steps for implementation, and potential bugs that may arise during the process.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: You need an active AWS account.
- **S3 Bucket**: Create an S3 bucket where you will store the uploaded files.
- **IAM User**: Create an IAM user with programmatic access and permissions to use S3 (specifically `s3:PutObject`).
- **Next.js Application**: A working Next.js application setup.
- **Environment Variables**: Set up the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```env
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
S3_REGION=your_region
```

## Steps to Implement

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

In your Next.js project, install the necessary AWS SDK packages [^2][^3]:

```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
```

### Step 2: Create API Route to Generate Signed URL

Create a new file at `app/api/presigned-url/route.ts` [^4] and add the following code:

```typescript
import { getSignedUrl } from '@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner';
import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

const client = new S3Client({
  region: process.env.S3_REGION,
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: process.env.S3_ACCESS_KEY,
    secretAccessKey: process.env.S3_SECRET_KEY,
  },
});

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const { searchParams } = request.nextUrl;
  const fileName = searchParams.get('file');

  if (!fileName) {
    return Response.json(
      { error: 'File query parameter is required' },
      { status: 400 }
    );
  }

  const command = new PutObjectCommand({
    Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET_NAME,
    Key: fileName,
  });

  const url = await getSignedUrl(client, command, { expiresIn: 60 });

  return Response.json({ presignedUrl: url });
}
```

### Step 3: Upload File from Client Side

On the client side, use the generated signed URL to upload files. Hereâ€™s an example using Fetch API:

```typescript
async function uploadFile(file) {
  const currentTime = Date.now();
  const fileName = `${file.name}-${currentTime}`; // Append current time to the file name

  // Get presigned URL
  const response = await fetch(
    `/api/presigned-url?file=${encodeURIComponent(fileName)}`
  );
  const data = await response.json();

  if (data.presignedUrl) {
    // Upload the file to S3 using the presigned URL
    const uploadResponse = await fetch(data.presignedUrl, {
      method: 'PUT',
      body: file,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': file.type,
      },
    });

    if (uploadResponse.ok) {
      console.log('File uploaded successfully:', data.presignedUrl);
      return data.presignedUrl; // Return the S3 link or key as needed
    } else {
      console.error('Upload failed:', uploadResponse.statusText);
    }
  } else {
    console.error('Failed to get presigned URL:', data.error);
  }
}
```

## Setting Up Lifecycle Policy for Cleanup

- To delete PDF files in the "pdfs" folder after they have been stored for 30 days from their creation date:
- Sign in to AWS Management Console and navigate to S3.
- Select your bucket and go to the Management tab.
- Click on Create lifecycle rule. [^5]
- Name your rule (e.g., "DeletePDFsAfter30Days").
- Limit the scope to specific prefixes and enter pdfs/.
- Under lifecycle rule actions, select Expire current versions of objects and set it to delete objects after 30 days from creation.
- Review and create the rule.

## Possible Bugs

- Invalid AWS Credentials: Ensure that your AWS access key and secret key are correct and have sufficient permissions.
- CORS Issues: If you encounter CORS errors when uploading files, ensure your S3 bucket has the correct CORS configuration. [^6]
- Network Issues: Uploads may fail due to network connectivity problems; handle such errors gracefully in your application.
- File Size Limitations: Ensure that you are aware of any size limitations imposed by your application or AWS services.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can successfully implement file uploads from a Next.js app to an S3 bucket using signed URLs and set up lifecycle policies for automatic cleanup of old files.
