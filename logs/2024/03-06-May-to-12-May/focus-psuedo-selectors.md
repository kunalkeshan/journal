## Focus, Focus Within, Focus Visible Psuedo Selectors 

Got to understand the difference between these 3 and how to use them. `:focus` is activited when a element is clicked, tapped or tabbed over by the keyboards `Tab` key. `:focus-within` selects the element if any of it's children have been clicked, tapped or tabbed over by the keyboards `Tab` key and `:focus-visible` is used to apply focus when the keyboards `Tab` key is used to nativate towards it and not focus via and other focus events, this is usually used when you want to retain the theme of the website, and also make it accessible for users using keyboards to navigate around the website.
