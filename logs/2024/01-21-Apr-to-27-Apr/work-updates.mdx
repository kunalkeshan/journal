# Work updates

Officially started work at Trustworthy, annd assigned to work on a feature end-to-end (using next.js as frontend and nest.js as backend). Focusing on the frontend as now, creating the components. 

Along with that, trying to take up initiative on writing documentation for the team and the dev process in general. Came across this post that helped clear somethings in particular to database documentation.
