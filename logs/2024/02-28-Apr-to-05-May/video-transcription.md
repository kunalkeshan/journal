## Video Transcription 

Turns out you don't need to reinvent the wheel ðŸ˜…. AWS [^1] & GCP [^2] both offer speech-to-text transcription services at a decent price. 

Planning to use this at Trustworthy for video transcription, not at the moment, but will have to get to this eventually.

p.s. Transcribing is the process of writing out a copy of something, while transcription is the written version of something spoken. (somewhat the same, just different way of how AWS & GCP refer to the same thing)
