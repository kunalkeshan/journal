# Using Nginx to Reverse Proxy

## What is Nginx? [^1]

Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance web server, reverse proxy server, and load balancer.

It is designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently and is often used to serve static files, manage load balancing, and reverse proxying requests to backend servers.

## What is Reverse Proxy?

A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices (like browsers or mobile apps) and backend servers.

Its primary job is to forward client requests to appropriate backend services and return the server's response to the client.

**Key benefits**:

- Load Balancing: Distribute traffic across multiple servers to optimize performance.
- Security: Hide the details of backend servers from clients, making it harder for attackers to target them directly.
- SSL Termination: Handle SSL/TLS encryption and decryption.
- Caching: Cache content to improve response times and reduce load on backend servers.

## Implementing Reverse Proxy

- Installing nginx [^2]

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

On CentOS/Red Hat:

```shell
sudo yum install nginx
```

Or visit [nginx: download](https://nginx.org/en/download.html) to find a relevant version.

- Create the configuration

```conf
# Main context directives
worker_processes auto;  # Automatically set number of worker processes

events {
    worker_connections 1024;  # Maximum number of simultaneous connections
}

http {
  server {
      listen 80;  # Listen on port 80 for incoming requests

      location /api/v1/users {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users;  # Forward to localhost:8080/api/v1/users
          proxy_set_header Host $host;                  # Preserve the original Host header
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;     # Pass the real client IP
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;  # Add forwarded IPs
      }

      location /api/v1/products {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:8081/api/v1/products;  # Forward to localhost:8081/api/v1/products
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      }

      location /api/v1/orders {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:8082/api/v1/orders;  # Forward to localhost:8082/api/v1/orders
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      }
  }
}
```

- Explanation

  - `worker_processes auto;`: Dynamically determines the optimal number of worker processes based on the number of CPU cores available.
  - `worker_connections 1024;`: Sets the maximum number of simultaneous connections each worker process can handle. This effectively determines the total concurrent connections supported.
  - `listen 80;`: Tells Nginx to listen for incoming HTTP requests on port 80 (default for non-secure HTTP traffic).
  - `location /api/v1/users`: Matches any request whose path starts with `/api/v1/users`.
  - `proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users;`: Forwards the request to the backend service running on localhost (the same machine as Nginx) at port 8080.
  - `proxy_set_header Host $host;`: Ensures the backend server sees the original Host header sent by the client.
  - `proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;`: Passes the actual IP address of the client to the backend, making it available for logging or debugging.
  - `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;`: Appends the client IP to the X-Forwarded-For header. This is useful for tracking client requests in a chain of proxies.

- Run nginx

```shell
nginx -g 'daemon off;'
```

Starts nginx and prevents it from running as a background process.

Alternatively, start Nginx as a service:

```shell
sudo systemctl start nginx
```
