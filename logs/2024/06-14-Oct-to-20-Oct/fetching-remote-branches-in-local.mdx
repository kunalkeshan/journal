# Fetching Remote Branches in Local

Was working on a project and needed to fetch a branch from remote repository to do some changes. I knew the branch existed on remote, but was feeling lazy to go to github and check out the name. 

So, I did what any developer would do, spend an hour to find another way to do it, instead of spending a few seconds to just look it up from the repository. 

Learnt a new command to list all the remote branches locally. [^1]

```bash
git branch -r
```

> This Git command will show you remote branches. The -r flag here is short for --remotes.
