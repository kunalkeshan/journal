# Tagging

Been working on creating tags for Stejassys for the past 2-3 months now and was pushing production tags directly so far.

Today had to release a tag, which was a potential improvement for an upcoming tag. 

Learned the term `rc` (Release Candidate) and tagging using it. 

eg: 

`v1.1-rc-branch-name` shows that the next version (v1.1) is a possible relase candidate from the branch (branch name). 

Cool Stuff.

edit: `rc` comes after the version
