# Masking Images Using SVGS

Sometimes plain images are boring, having a pattern around, inside or surrounding an image can bring out a different aspect of the image compared to just leaving the image plain on the website.

Masking images or applying a pattern around a image based on some other image or svg can be helpful and there is just a property that is helpful in such cases.

The `mask-image` [^1] property allows you to mask images, and svgs over other images. Meaning this property is valid for image tags and the target mask being applied to an image.

My use case was to apply a svg pattern over an image and it was quite straightforward, [^2] and [^3]

- Get your SVG in the same file preferable as the image.
- Apply `width` and `height` properties of the SVG tag to be 0.
- Wrap the contents of the SVG Tag with the `mask` tag with an id attribute. eg: `id="mask"`.
- Apply the CSS Property to mask the SVG over an image.
  ```css
  image {
    mask-image: url(#mask);
  }
  ```

and watch the magic happen.
