## Back to CS50

Resuming the learning flow for CS50 after over 3 months. I'm reading / revising the concepts I've covered so far, till lecture 3 as of now to get caught up and get in a flow. 

I'll also additionally read the code I have written in my previous assignments to get back in loop. Taking it one step at a time. 

Covered the starting lectures for now - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/notes/0 and revised about bits, binary, ASCII, Unicode, Psuedo Programming and Scratch.
